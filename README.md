This repository contains the generated Xcode files for the Safari extension. 

The extension is currently not available in the App Store and will not be until we recieve enough [donations](https://spotsponsorblock.org/donate) 
to be able to pay the 99 USD per year [Apple developer fee](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships).

See [this wiki page](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/wiki/Safari) for how to build this yourself.

Forked from [SponsorBlockSafari](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlockSafari).
